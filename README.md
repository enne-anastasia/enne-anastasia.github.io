# My personal website

This is my personal website build with Rmd. It is multilingual, although that was done in a manner, that is not optimal, nor clever.

## Structure

In the root project folder we have:

 - `_site` folder that contains the website to publish
 - `css` folder with `.css` files
 - `img` folder for any graphics used on the high level pages
 - `render.R` script that renders every page needed for the website
 - `EN` folder with main (English) version of the website
 - `DE` folder with secondary (German) version of the website
